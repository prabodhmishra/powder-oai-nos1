# powder-oai-nos1

This profile allocates hardware resources for deploying an OAI eNB and UE in **noS1** mode (no core network) in a controlled RF environment on the POWDER platform. The inlcuded scripts automate node setup, building the OAI binaries, and starting the nework. The steps followed in these scripts are largely based on [this](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/wikis/HowToConnectOAIENBWithOAIUEWithoutS1Interface)
tutorial.
