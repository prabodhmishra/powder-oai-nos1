# powder-oai-nos1

This profile allocates hardware resources for deploying two OAI eNBs and a UE in **noS1** mode (no core network) in a controlled RF environment on the POWDER platform. The inlcuded scripts automate node setup, building the OAI binaries, and starting the network. The steps followed in these scripts are largely based on [this](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/wikis/HowToConnectOAIENBWithOAIUEWithoutS1Interface)
tutorial.

This profile is used to try establish connection between 1 UE and 2 eNBs simultaneously through broadcast.
